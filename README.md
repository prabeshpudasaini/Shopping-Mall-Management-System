The Shopping Mall Management System allows more than one shop owner to set up different shops, to sell various products under one roof i.e. mall. 

It is a desktop-based application which at its very basic, provides for an environment that allows any person wishing to setup shop in the mall to setup and maintains their own shop in the mall. 

The System can even generate the reports about transactions of the mall. This system will help the mall to manage their large data and to perform day-to-day activities more quickly, securely and efficiently.
