# **Description:**

The system has been designed using Java as the programming language and MySQL as the database server.

The Shopping Mall Management System allows more than one shop owner to set up different shops, to sell various products under one roof i.e. mall. 

It is a desktop-based application which at its very basic, provides an environment that allows any person wishing to set up shop in the mall to set up and maintain their shop in the mall. 

The System can even generate reports about transactions in the mall. This system will help the mall to manage its large data and to perform day-to-day activities more quickly, securely and efficiently.
